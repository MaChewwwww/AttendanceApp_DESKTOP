---

## üõ† Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaChewwwww/AttendanceApp_DESKTOP.git
cd AttendanceApp_DESKTOP
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Required Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Email Settings (Required for Email Verification)

#### Quick Setup
```bash
# Copy the example file to create your .env
copy .env.example .env    # Windows
cp .env.example .env      # macOS/Linux
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You must rename `.env.example` to `.env` for the application to work!**

The `.env.example` file is just a template. Your actual configuration must be in a file named `.env` (without the `.example` extension).

#### Google SMTP Setup (Step-by-Step)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google Account**
   - Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
   - Navigate to Security > 2-Step Verification
   - Enable 2-factor authentication if not already enabled

2. **Generate an App Password**
   - In Google Account settings, go to Security > App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and your device/app name
   - Copy the 16-character app password (format: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`)

3. **Edit your .env file (NOT the .env.example file)**
   - Open the `.env` file you created in step 1
   - Update these lines with your actual credentials:
   ```env
   EMAIL_ADDRESS=your-actual-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-actual-16-character-app-password
   ```

4. **Test Email Configuration** (Optional but Recommended)
   ```bash
   python -c "from app.email_service import EmailService; service = EmailService(); print(service.test_email_configuration())"
   ```

#### File Setup Checklist:
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Edit `.env` with your Gmail credentials  
- [ ] Do NOT edit `.env.example` (this is just the template)
- [ ] Do NOT commit your `.env` file to version control

#### Important Notes:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use App Password, not your regular Gmail password**
- ‚úÖ **App passwords are safer and can be revoked if needed**
- üîí **Never commit your actual .env file to version control**
- üìß **The system sends emails for OTP verification, password reset, and registration confirmation**
- üìÅ **The .env file should be in the root directory (same level as main.py)**

#### Troubleshooting Email Issues:
- **File not found error**: Make sure you renamed `.env.example` to `.env`
- **Email credentials not working**: Verify 2FA is enabled on your Google Account
- **Invalid password**: Ensure you're using the App Password (16 characters)
- **Email not sending**: Check spam/junk folders for test emails
- **Permission denied**: Generate a new App Password if issues persist
- **Environment variables not loading**: Verify no extra spaces in EMAIL_ADDRESS or EMAIL_PASSWORD

### 6. Initialize the Database
```bash
python create_db.py
```

### 7. Seed Initial Users (Optional but Recommended)

#### Basic Seeding (Default)
```bash
python create_seed_users.py
```

This creates a comprehensive database with:
- **5 Academic Programs** (BSIT, BSCS, BSIS, BSCpE, BSSE)
- **30 Faculty Members** with realistic roles and status distribution
- **100 Students** distributed across programs and year levels
- **23+ Courses** specific to each program
- **25+ Sections** with realistic enrollment distributions
- **Course Assignments** for faculty with schedules and room assignments
- **60 Days of Attendance Logs** with realistic attendance patterns:
  - 55% of students have 90%+ attendance rate
  - Realistic performance distribution (excellent, good, average, poor)
  - 3 classes per week schedule for comprehensive analytics

#### Student Distribution by Program:
- **BSIT**: 30 students (most popular program)
- **BSCS**: 25 students 
- **BSIS**: 20 students
- **BSCpE**: 15 students
- **BSSE**: 10 students (newest program)

#### Massive Seeding (For Testing/Demo)
```bash
python create_seed_users_massive.py
```

This creates an extensive database with:
- **5 Academic Programs** with full course catalogs
- **30 Faculty Members** with comprehensive assignments
- **500+ Students** with realistic distribution across all programs and sections
- **Enhanced Attendance Patterns** with 90+ days of historical data
- **Advanced Analytics Data** for comprehensive testing of all dashboard features

This seed data provides:
- ‚úÖ **Realistic analytics** with proper attendance trends
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive program management** testing
- ‚úÖ **Faculty course assignments** with schedules
- ‚úÖ **Student performance categories** for meaningful statistics
- ‚úÖ **Multi-year data** for historical analysis
- ‚úÖ **Program filtering** by academic year and semester
